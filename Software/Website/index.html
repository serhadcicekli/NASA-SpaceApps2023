            <h1>About EMIT</h1>
            <h2>What is EMIT and what will it do?</h2>
            <p>In 2020, winds in Africa blew surface mineral dust into the atmosphere, which crossed the Atlantic Ocean and affected states from Florida to Texas. Mineral dust has many impacts on the Earth. Today we know that mineral dust originates from the arid land regions of our planet, but we know very little about its composition. EMIT's mission is to comprehensively measure the mineral composition of regions of the Earth where mineral dust accumulates to help scientists understand how windblown dust particles heat or cool our planetary atmosphere.</p>
            <h3>So, how will EMIT do this?</h3>  
            <p>The EMIT instrument is an imaging spectrometer. When various wavelengths of light (spectrum) are distributed across the instrument's detector, it displays unique spectral signatures that indicate the mineral composition of the surface. EMIT acquires more than 100000 such spectra every second, mapping the composition of minerals on the Earth's surface.</p>  
            <h2>What new technologies is the EMIT project developing?</h2>
            <h3>Atmospheric composition</h3>
            <p>EMIT will measure the concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and other pollutants in the atmosphere. This information will help scientists to understand how the Earth's atmosphere is changing and to predict the effects of climate change.</p>
            <h3>Radar sensors</h3>
            <p>EMIT is developing radar sensors that will be able to measure the precipitation and cloud cover over the Earth's surface. This will allow scientists to improve their understanding of the Earth's water cycle and to predict weather patterns more accurately</p>
            <h3>Hyperspectral imaging sensors</h3>
            <p>EMIT is developing hyperspectral imaging sensors that wiæll be able to measure the spectral composition of light at each pixel in an image. This will allow scientists to identify different types of materials and surfaces, and to track changes in the Earth's environment over time.</p>
            <h3>Lidar sensors</h3>
            <p>EMIT is developing lidar sensors that will be able to measure the distance to objects on the Earth's surface. This will allow scientists to create detailed maps of the Earth's terrain and to track changes in sea level and ice cover.</p>

            <h1>Frequenty Asked Questions</h1>
            <h2>What do these spectroscopy data tell us?</h2>
            <p>Many minerals on the Earth’s surface have a distinct ‘spectral signature’ that is akin to a fingerprint, making them visible to an imaging spectrometer. The EMIT mission will measure the top 10 minerals that make up atmospheric dust, allowing us to learn how much of these different minerals are in the atmosphere.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>What is an imaging spectrometer?</h2>
            <p>An imaging spectrometer is a device that measures multiple wavelengths of light simultaneously at multiple locations. The EMIT device observes approximately 7 times the visible spectrum observable by humans, in more than 300 channels.</p>
            <br/>

            <h2>Why is heating and cooling from atmospheric dust important?</h2>
            <p>There are many significant factors that determine our planet’s climate trajectory. EMIT emphasizes radiative forcing, which is about how much heat is trapped or reflected by the atmosphere. Even though radiative forcing might not be the largest component of the climate budget, it is the most uncertain. It’s so uncertain that it can either have a cooling or heating effect. EMIT aims to control this uncertainty and pin down the “signal” in radiative forcing to either a cooling or heating impact.</p>
            <br/>

            <h2>Which greenhouse gases does EMIT detect?</h2>
            <p>EMIT can detect carbon dioxide and methane, two predominant greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, at high concentrations. While both of these gases are invisible to the human eye, methane and carbon dioxide have distinct spectral fingerprints in the shortwave infrared (1900-2500nm) that allow for the mapping of point source greenhouse gas emissions with EMIT data.</p>
